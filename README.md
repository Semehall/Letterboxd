<h1> Letteboxd Redesign</h1>
<h2>Case Study: Redesigning Letterboxd for a More Inclusive & User-Friendly Experience. </h2>


<h3>Overview:</h3>
Letterboxd is a popular social platform for movie lovers to log, review, and discover films. While widely used, the platform has usability and accessibility challenges that impact diverse users. This redesign project aimed to improve usability, accessibility, and overall user experience by addressing pain points and introducing new features, 
including expanding support for TV shows.


<h3>Problem Statement:</h3>
Have you ever wanted to log a TV show on Letterboxd, only to realize the platform doesn’t support episodic content? While Letterboxd is a favorite among film lovers, its lack of TV show tracking leaves users frustrated. Additionally, the absence of light mode and accessibility features like text-to-speech make the platform harder to use for diverse audiences.

To address these challenges, this redesign enhances navigation, accessibility, and content expansion while preserving Letterboxd’s core identity.

 <h3>User Segments</h3>
            <p>Through research, I identified three key user groups:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Movie Enthusiasts – Users who only log movies and have no need for TV show tracking.</li>
                <li>TV & Movie Watchers– Users who want a unified platform for movies and TV shows.</li>
                <li>Accessibility Advocates – Users needing features like text-to-speech, customizable fonts, and color contrast.</li>
<h3>Key Questions</h3>
<p>During user interviews, I asked:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>How often do you use Letterboxd?</li>
               <li> What accessibility challenges have you faced?</li>
               <li> Would you use text-to-speech for reading reviews?</li>
                <li>How important is having a light mode?</li>
              <li> Would a TV show tracking feature improve your experience?</li>
